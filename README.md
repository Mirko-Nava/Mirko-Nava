# Hi there, I'm Mirko Nava

Doing my PhD @ [Robotics Lab](https://idsia-robotics.github.io/) at [IDSIA](http://www.idsia.ch/idsia_en.html), Lugano ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, on Self-Supervised Robot Learning and Uncertainty Awareness.

Using ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078D7?style=flat&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white) I develop ![ROS](https://img.shields.io/badge/ROS-15253E?style=flat&logo=ros&logoColor=white) packages written in ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-0078D7?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=FFDD55) and using ![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-EE4C2C?style=flat&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white) for deep learning.
