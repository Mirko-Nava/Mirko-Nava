## Hi there, I'm Mirko Nava

Doing my PhD @ [Robotics Lab](https://idsia-robotics.github.io/) at [IDSIA](http://www.idsia.ch/idsia_en.html) on Self-Supervised Learning applied to mobile robotics, Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Awareness.

**Looking for an interesting internship opportunity.**


#### News and Updates

- **March 2020**, The human brain abstracts out complexity by assuming priors over the environment; wouldn't it be cool to imbue neural networks with such priors?
- **February 2020**, The work I co-authored *"Path Planning With Local Motion Estimations"* has been published on the [RAL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8988152) journal.
- **January 2019**, My first article *"Learning long-range perception using self-supervision from short-range sensors and odometry"* has been published on the [RAL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8624299) journal.
- **January 2019**, A demo of my work *"Learning to Perceive Long-Range Obstacles Using Self-Supervision from Short-Range Sensors"* has been shown at [AAAI 2019](https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5071) in Honolulu HI. Check out the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvtDGO43qew).
